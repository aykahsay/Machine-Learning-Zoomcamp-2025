# Machine-Learning-Zoomcamp-2025
This repository contains my work and notes from ML Zoomcamp, a free 4-month course on Machine Learning Engineering. Topics include linear regression, classification, decision trees, ensemble learning, neural networks, deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras, and deploying ML models with Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes.
